    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code" style="margin: 0;">
        Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code,[9] is a
        source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and
        web browsers.[10][11] Features include support for debugging, syntax
        highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and
        embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard
        shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality. In
        the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked
        the most popular developer environment tool among 86,544 respondents, with
        73.71% reporting that they use it.
